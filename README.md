Project is done with java 20 and angular 14

Instruction to run application:
- install node.js version 16
- make maven "clean install" of java project
- launch spring boot main.
- from angular-app folder launch: npm install
- from angular-app folder launch: npm run start
- Application respond on url: http://localhost:4200/

notes:
- There are already points at the beginning
- I voluntarily leaved the possibility to insert points with same coordinates of point already present in the space.
- Is possible to insert decimal points using the point and not the comma (es. 2.5)
- I put that all points are visible from beginning because is more clear what happens when points are added or removed
